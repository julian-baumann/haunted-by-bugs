    <h1>Hunted by bugs</h1>
    <h2>My journey through the world of software botches</h2>

    <p>
        Walking through the streets of Germany, unsuspecting... But what's that?! A bug is approaching.
        Careful and on guard, the man pulled his weapon and took a snap.
        Then he did what everyone would do, whose life is condemned to be hounded by software botches; he
        created a website to show his suffers. <br />
        <br />
        Of course, in the world of software programming, everyone botches sometimes. I'm not proud of it,
        but certainly I do it myself sometimes. These posts are not to blame somebody, but rather to enjoy some uncritically software bugs.<br />
        <br />
        This is the journey of a man always on guard, always being hounded by software bugs.<br />
        <br />
        <!-- And what could be more fitting, to show his snapshots, than a botched website that looks like it was developed in the 80s. -->

            There he was. Waiting on a train station, unknowing that a bug was silently approaching. <br />
            Well, &amp;quot; encoding can be hard sometimes &amp;quot;

            Cookies are getting quite expensive these days.

            While trying to buy something from the butcher, he noticed. <br />
            Something was wrong here.

            Driven by hunger, he almost missed this subtle bug.

            While waiting in the line of a supermarket, slowly turning around, he saw the inevitable. <br />
            An exception has been thrown! <br />
            <!-- This image marks the first moment of realization, that he was and will ever be hunter by bugs. -->
